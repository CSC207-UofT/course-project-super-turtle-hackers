## For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:
### (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or
### (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

#### Principle 1: Equitable Use
- All the input boxes have sample inputs to improve clarity
- All the input boxes are appropriately labelled in our code for screen readers to understand
- Users can create passwords and have their data deleted at any time
- A future feature we plan to implement is distress/harassment reports to ensure user safety.
#### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
As none of the inputs or website usage are time constrained, this principle doesn't apply to us. 
#### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- When the user goes through the website, there is a clear flow of information and the user can easily understand it.
- The website is consistent with user expectations and intuition.
- All the text and labels use simple vocabolary.
- In the future we plan to implement error messages for wrong inputs.
#### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- We provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings by using a light background and dark text.
- We also maximise the legibility of essential information by reducing distractions.
- Our website is compatible with screen readers
#### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- Not applicable as our project is not being used to help navigate a physical environment and is not meant to be used in hazardous situations.
#### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- Users can copy/paste their information or use auto-fill for everything except password input.
- No repetitive movements as swiping and scrolling is eliminated.
- Allows user to maintain a neutral body position.

#### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Everything is in line of sight and easily organized.
- All text can be read within reading distance of screen.
- The website is compatible for screen readers.
- In the future, we will make it work with audio input devices.

## Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
This program would be marketed towards students taking any courses on any kind of platform. This can be an online platform, a school, or a university that is verifiable. It would be ideal if the student is enrolled in at least 3 courses, as they would have more courses to find other students in. The program could also be modified to match students in niche training/summer camps as long as they are of 30 students at minimum and run at least 3 classes. 

## Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
 
This program is less likely to be used by students who are taking less than 3 classes or no classes at all. It is also less likely to be used by people whose primary input method is audio. Students who are involved in multiple extracurriculars, family commitments and/or part-time jobs are less likely to use this program as they may not have time to spare. Visiting/Exchange students are less likely to use this program as they are present in the university for a short period of time.
