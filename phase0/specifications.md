Below is the roadmap, or stages of implementation, we have planned for our project. Note that these stages do not necessarily correspond to the course project phases.

## Stage 1

Each student creates a profile that includes their name, year of study, courses they’re taking and 5 interests. Every year students must update their year of study and courses and can update their interests. Every term, they will also have the option of updating their courses until the second week of the term. The system will match them with other student(s) in the same course (will take lecture and tutorial timings into consideration later) with similar interests.

*Note: We match only on one interest and give two matches with a chat option.*

## Stage 2

Each user has the chance to start a conversation with x(2 or 3) number of other students and conversation starter prompts will be provided based on course and interest. At the end of the day, each user can choose whether they want to continue the conversation. If both users choose “yes”, the app will automatically exchange their pre-defined social media/contact information with their conversation partner. If only one of them says yes, both will be asked whether they want to have the chance to match again with the same person. This time, only if both say yes then they will be potentially matched again in the future. If neither user consents to continue the conversation, they can still send a message request at a later point. Users will be able to see their match history.

Each chat has a distress feature and report feature enabled. Once a report is filed, the chat is immediately closed and sent for review. Both the users involved will no longer participate in matches until the review is completed. If the distress feature is enabled, hotline numbers will be displayed and [to be discussed]

Restrict feature -> blocking 1 person and not matching the person -> chat is deleted and unmatched

## Stage 3

If time permits, users can add a friend that they met from outside the app using an ID code. Their friend will be invited to the app and will be given a choice to be matched with other users or to build a timetable only with you. The app will show the lecture/tutorial section both users can attend. If the users wanted to hangout/study together, the app will show you the time slots where both users are free.
